Verification
============

The verification environment (testbenches, testcases, etc.) for the CV32E40P
core can be found at  `core-v-verif <https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif>`_.
It is recommended to start by reviewing the
`CORE-V Verification Strategy <https://docs.openhwgroup.org/projects/core-v-verif/en/latest>`_.

v1.0.0 verification
-------------------

In early 2021 the CV32E40P achieved Functional RTL Freeze (released with cv32e40p_v1.0.0 version), meaning that is has been fully verified as per its
`Verification Plan <https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif/blob/cb2cc35fe27e0961ea21864f62e6104c238d25cd/cv32e40p/docs/VerifPlans/README.md#cv32e40p-v1-verification-plans>`_.
Final functional, code and test coverage reports can be found `here <https://github.com/openhwgroup/programs/blob/b72d726665b31b3df5befc5f672b745f814ea709/Project-Descriptions-and-Plans/CV32E40Pv1/Milestone-data/Reports/index.html>`_.

The unofficial start date for the CV32E40P verification effort is 2020-02-27,
which is the date the core-v-verif environment "went live".  Between then and
RTL Freeze, a total of 47 RTL issues and 38 User Manual issues were identified
and resolved [1]_.

A breakdown of the RTL issues is as follows:

   It is a testament on the quality of the work done by the PULP platform team
   that it took a team of professional verification engineers more than 9 months
   to find all these issues.

Verification environment is described in `CORE-V Verification Strategy <https://docs.openhwgroup.org/projects/core-v-verif/en/latest>`_ and used the so-called `Step-and-Compare 2.0 <https://docs.openhwgroup.org/projects/core-v-verif/en/latest/cv32_env.html#step-and-compare-2-0>`_ methodology. It is using an Imperas® model connected in the test-bench through an RVVI interface as shown by following figure:

  ImperasDV framework

CV32E40Pv2 achieved RTL Freeze (released with cv32e40p_v2.0.0 version) mid-April 2024, meaning that is has been fully verified as per its
`Verification Plan <https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif/blob/cb2cc35fe27e0961ea21864f62e6104c238d25cd/cv32e40p/docs/VerifPlans/README.md>`_.
Final functional, code and test coverage reports can be found here: `CV32E40P v2.0.0 Report <https://github.com/openhwgroup/programs/tree/b72d726665b31b3df5befc5f672b745f814ea709/Project-Descriptions-and-Plans/CV32E40Pv2/RTL_Freeze_v2.0.0>`_.

It is to be mentioned that CV32E40Pv2 has successfully executed `RISCOF (RISC-V COmpatibility Framework) <https://riscof.readthedocs.io/en/stable>`_ for RV32IMCF extensions.
Report can be found `here <https://github.com/openhwgroup/programs/tree/.../RTL_Freeze_v2.0.0/...>`_.

Formal verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To accelerate the verification of more than 300 XPULP instructions, Formal Verification methodology has been used with Siemens EDA Onespin tool and its RISC-V ISA Processor Verification app.

The XPULP instructions pseudo-code description using Sail language have been added to the RISC-V ISA app to successfully formally verify all the CV32E40P instructions, including the previously verified standard IMC together with the new F, Zfinx and XPULP extensions and all additional custom CSRs.

Example:

.. code-block:: text

        {
          "name": "CV.SDOTUP.B",
          "disassembly": "cv.sdotup.b {rd},{rs1},{rs2}",
          "decoding": "1001100 rs2 rs1 001 rd/rs3 1111011",
          "restrictions": "",
          "execution": "X(rd) = X(rs3) + EXTZ(mul(X(rs1)[7..0],X(rs2)[7..0])) + 
                                         EXTZ(mul(X(rs1)[15..8],X(rs2)[15..8])) + 
                                         EXTZ(mul(X(rs1)[23..16],X(rs2)[23..16])) + 
                                         EXTZ(mul(X(rs1)[31..24],X(rs2)[31..24]))"
        },

Those SAIL instructions description are then used to automatically generate more than 430 assertions and 29 CSRs descriptions.
Those assertions have been applied on the 7 different configurations listed in :ref:`Verified configurations` table.

RTL code coverage is generated using Siemens EDA Onespin Quantify tool which uses RTL mutation to check assertions quality and can produce standard UCDB database that can be merged with simulation one afterwards.

Simulation verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

core-v-verif verification environment for v1.0.0 was using a *step&compare* methodology with an instruction set simulator (ISS) from Imperas Software as the reference model.
This strategy was successful, but inefficient because the *step&compare* logic in the testbench must compensate for the cycle-time effects of events that are asynchronous to the instruction stream such as interrupts, debug resets plus bus errors and random delays on instruction fetch and load/store memory buses.
For verification of v2.0.0 release of the CV32E40P core, the step-and-compare and the ISS have been replaced by a true reference model (RM) called ImperasDV. In addition, the Imperas Reference Model has been extended to support the v2 XPULP instructions specification.

Another innovation for v2.0.0 was the adoption of a standardized tracer interface to the DUT and RM, based on the open-source RISC-V Verification Interface (RVVI). The use of well documented, standardized interfaces greatly simplifies the integration of the DUT with the RM.

Results summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

30 issues were identified by Formal Verification and 10 by Simulation methodologies, all have been resolved.

Here is the breakdown of all the issues:

Tracer
------

The module ``cv32e40p_rvfi_trace`` can be used to create a log of the executed instructions.
It is a behavioral, non-synthesizable, module instantiated in the example testbench that is provided for
the ``cv32e40p_top``. It can be enabled during simulation by defining **CV32E40P_RVFI_TRACE_EXECUTION**.

Output file
^^^^^^^^^^^

All traced instructions are written to a log file.
The log file is named ``trace_core.log``.

Trace output format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The trace output is in tab-separated columns.

1. **Time**: The current simulation time.
2. **Cycle**: The number of cycles since the last reset.
3. **PC**: The program counter
4. **Instr**: The executed instruction (base 16).
   32 bit wide instructions (8 hex digits) are uncompressed instructions, 16 bit wide instructions (4 hex digits) are compressed instructions.
5. **Decoded instruction**: The decoded (disassembled) instruction in a format equal to what objdump produces when calling it like ``objdump -Mnumeric -Mno-aliases -D``.
   - Unsigned numbers are given in hex (prefixed with ``0x``), signed numbers are given as decimal numbers.
   - Numeric register names are used (e.g. ``x1``).
   - Symbolic CSR names are used.
   - Jump/branch targets are given as absolute address if possible (PC + immediate).
6. **Register and memory contents**: For all accessed registers, the value before and after the instruction execution is given. Writes to registers are indicated as ``registername=value``, reads as ``registername:value``. For memory accesses, the physical address (PA) of the loaded or stored data is reported as well.
