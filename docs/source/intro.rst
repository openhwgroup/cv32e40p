Introduction
=============

CV32E40P is a 4-stage in-order 32-bit RISC-V
processor core. The ISA of CV32E40P
has been extended to support multiple additional instructions including
hardware loops, post-increment load and store instructions and
additional ALU instructions that are not part of the standard RISC-V
ISA. :numref:`blockdiagram` shows a block diagram of the core.

Bus Interfaces
--------------

The Instruction Fetch and Load/Store data bus interfaces are compliant to the **OBI** (Open Bus Interface) protocol.
See `OBI-v1.2.pdf <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openhwgroup/obi/188c87089975a59c56338949f5c187c1f8841332/OBI-v1.2.pdf>`_ for details about the protocol.
Additional information can be found in the :ref:`instruction-fetch` and :ref:`load-store-unit` chapters of this document.

The Auxiliary Processing Unit bus interface is derived from to the OBI (Open Bus Interface) protocol, see the :ref:`apu` chapter of this document.

--------------------

CV32E40P is a standards-compliant 32-bit RISC-V processor.
It follows these specifications:

* `RISC-V Instruction Set Manual, Volume I: User-Level ISA, Document Version 20191213 (December 13, 2019) <https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/Ratified-IMAFDQC/riscv-spec-20191213.pdf>`_

Synthesis guidelines
--------------------

The CV32E40P core is fully synthesizable.
It has been designed mainly for ASIC designs, but FPGA synthesis
is supported as well.

All the files in the ``rtl`` and ``rtl/include`` folders are synthesizable.
The user should first decide whether to use the flip-flop or latch-based register-file ( see :ref:`register-file`).
However, the use of the flip-flop-based register-file is the one suggested and used by default as it has been verified.
Secondly, the user must provide a clock-gating module that instantiates the clock-gating cells of the target technology. This file must have the same interface and module name of the one provided for simulation-only purposes
at ``bhv/cv32e40p_sim_clock_gate.sv`` (see :ref:`clock-gating-cell`).

The ``constraints/cv32e40p_core.sdc`` file provides an example of synthesis constraints.


ASIC Synthesis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ASIC synthesis is supported for CV32E40P. The whole design is completely
synchronous and uses positive-edge triggered flip-flops, except for the
register file, which can be implemented either with latches or with
flip-flops. See :ref:`register-file` for more details. The
core occupies an area of about 50 kGE when the latch based register file
is used. With the FPU, the area increases to about 90 kGE (30 kGE
FPU, 10 kGE additional register file). A technology specific implementation
of a clock gating cell as described in :ref:`clock-gating-cell` needs to
be provided.

FPGA Synthesis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FPGA synthesis is only supported for CV32E40P when the flip-flop based register
file is used as latches are not well supported on FPGAs.
The user needs to provide a technology specific implementation of a clock gating cell as described
in :ref:`clock-gating-cell`.

Verification
------------

The verification environment (testbenches, testcases, etc.) for the CV32E40P
core can be found at  `core-v-verif <https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif>`_.
It is recommended that you start by reviewing the
`CORE-V Verification Strategy <https://docs.openhwgroup.org/projects/core-v-verif/en/latest>`_.

In early 2021 the CV32E40P achieved Functional RTL Freeze, meaning that is has
been fully verified as per its
`Verification Plan <https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif/tree/cv32e40p/dev/cv32e40p/docs/VerifPlans/README.md>`_.
Final functional, code and test coverage reports can be found `here <https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif/blob/master/docs/Reports/cv32e40p/index.html>`_.

The unofficial start date for the CV32E40P verification effort is 2020-02-27,
which is the date the core-v-verif environment "went live".  Between then and
RTL Freeze, a total of 47 RTL issues and 38 User Manual issues were identified
and resolved [1]_.  A breakdown of the RTL issues is as follows:

History
-------

CV32E40P started its life as a fork of the OR10N CPU core based on the OpenRISC ISA. Then, under the name of RI5CY, it became a RISC-V core (2016), and it has been maintained by the PULP platform <https://pulp-platform.org> team until February 2020, when it has been contributed to OpenHW Group https://www.openhwgroup.org.

As RI5CY has been used in several projects, a list of all the changes made by OpenHW Group since February 2020 follows:

Memory-Protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Instruction and Data memory interfaces are now compliant with the OBI protocol (see `OBI-v1.2.pdf <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openhwgroup/obi/188c87089975a59c56338949f5c187c1f8841332/OBI-v1.2.pdf>`_).
Such memory interface is slightly different from the one used by RI5CY as: the grant signal can now be kept high by the bus even without the core raising a request; and the request signal does not depend anymore on the rvalid signal (no combinatorial dependency). The OBI is easier to be interfaced to the AMBA AXI and AHB protocols and improves timing as it removes rvalid->req dependency. Also, the protocol forces the address stability. Thus, the core can not retract memory requests once issued, nor can it change the issued address (as was the case for the RI5CY instruction memory interface).

RV32F Extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The FPU is not instantiated in the core EX stage anymore, and it must be attached to the APU interface.
Previously, RI5CY could select with a parameter whether the FPU was instantiated inside the EX stage or via the APU interface.

RV32A Extensions, Security and Memory Protection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CV32E40P core does not support the RV32A (atomic) extensions, the U-mode, and the PMP anymore.
Most of the previous RTL descriptions of these features have been kept but not maintained. The RTL code has been partially kept to allow previous users of these features to develop their own by reusing previously developed RI5CY modules.

CSR Address Re-Mapping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CV32E40P is fully compliant with RISC-V.
RI5CY used to have custom performance counters 32b wide (not compliant with RISC-V) in the CSR address space
{0x7A0, 0x7A1, 0x780-0x79F}. CV32E40P is fully compliant with the RISC-V spec.
The custom PULP HWLoop CSRs moved from the 0x7C* to RISC-V user custom read-only 0xCC0-0xCFF address space.

Interrupts
^^^^^^^^^^

RI5CY used to have a req plus a 5bits ID interrupt interface, supporting up to 32 interrupt requests (only one active at a time), with the priority defined outside in an interrupt controller. CV32E40P is now compliant with the CLINT RISC-V spec, extended with 16 custom interrupts lines called fast, for a total of 19 interrupt lines. They can be all active simultaneously, and priority and per-request interrupt enable bit is controlled by the core CLINT definition.

PULP HWLoop Spec
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

RI5CY supported two nested HWLoops. Every loop had a minimum of two instructions. The start and end of the loop addresses
could be misaligned, and the instructions in the loop body could be of any kind. CV32E40P has a more restricted spec for the
HWLoop (see  :ref:`hwloop-specs`).

Compliancy, bug fixing, code clean-up, and documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CV32E40P has been verified. It is fully compliant with RISC-V (RI5CY was partially compliant). Many bugs have been fixed, and the RTL code cleaned-up. The documentation has been formatted with reStructuredText and has been developed following at industrial quality level.

   It is a testament on the quality of the work done by the PULP platform team
   that it took a team of professonal verification engineers more than 9 months
   to find all these issues.
