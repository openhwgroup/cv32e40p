/// cf_math_pkg: Constant Function Implementations of Mathematical Functions for HDL Elaboration
///
/// This package contains a collection of mathematical functions that are commonly used when defining
/// the value of constants in HDL code.  These functions are implemented as Verilog constants
/// functions.  Introduced in Verilog 2001 (IEEE Std 1364-2001), a constant function (ยง 10.3.5) is a
/// function whose value can be evaluated at compile time or during elaboration.  A constant function
/// must be called with arguments that are constants.
